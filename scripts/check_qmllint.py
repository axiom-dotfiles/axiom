"""Run qmllint over the shell, failing only on warnings not in the baseline.

qmllint can't resolve `import qs.…` by itself, so this lints a copy of the
shell laid out as QML modules (scripts/qml_modules.py). Many of its warnings
are gaps in Quickshell's type info rather than bugs, so the known ones are
kept in scripts/qmllint-baseline.json, per file, as "category: message"
with a count (no line numbers, so unrelated edits don't churn it). A new
warning, or one more of a known kind in the same file, fails the check.

  scripts/check_qmllint.py                    lint (exit 1 on new warnings)
  scripts/check_qmllint.py --update-baseline  accept the current warnings
